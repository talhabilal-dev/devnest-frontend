# The Future of Web Development in 2025

As we approach 2025, the web development landscape continues to evolve at a rapid pace. New technologies, frameworks, and methodologies are emerging, changing how developers build applications and how users interact with them.

## AI-Driven Development

```
Artificial Intelligence
``` is becoming an integral part of the development process. From code completion to automated testing, AI tools are helping developers work more efficiently and produce higher quality code.

## WebAssembly Goes Mainstream

WebAssembly (Wasm) is gaining traction as a way to run high-performance code in the browser. By 2025, we expect to see more applications leveraging Wasm for complex computations, gaming, and multimedia processing.

## The Rise of Edge Computing

Edge computing is moving processing closer to where data is generated, reducing latency and improving user experience. Frameworks like Next.js and Remix are already embracing this approach with server components and distributed rendering.
